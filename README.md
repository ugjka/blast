## Cast your Linux audio to DLNA receivers

You need `pactl`, `parec` and `ffmpeg` executables/dependencies on your system to run Blast.

If you have all that then you can launch `blast` and it looks like this when you run it:

```
[user@user blast]$ ./blast 
----------
DLNA receivers
0: Kitchen
1: Phone
2: Bedroom
3: Livingroom TV
----------
Select the DLNA device:
[1]
----------
Audio sources
0: alsa_output.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo.monitor
1: alsa_input.pci-0000_00_1b.0.analog-stereo
2: bluez_output.D8_AA_59_95_96_B7.1.monitor
3: blast.monitor
----------
Select the audio source:
[2]
----------
Your LAN ip addresses
0: 192.168.1.14
1: 192.168.122.1
2: 2a04:ec00:b9ab:555:3c50:e6e8:8ea:211f
3: 2a04:ec00:b9ab:555:806d:800b:1138:8b1b
4: fe80::f4c2:c827:a865:35e5
----------
Select the lan IP address for the stream:
[0]
----------
2023/07/08 23:53:07 starting the stream on port 9000 (configure your firewall if necessary)
2023/07/10 23:53:07 stream URI: http://192.168.1.14:9000/stream.mp3
2023/07/08 23:53:07 setting av1transport URI and playing
```

There are also `-debug` and `-headers` flags if you want to inspect your DLNA device. Also, `-log` to inspect what parec and ffmpeg are doing.

## Tips and tricks

* If you choose `blast.monitor` as a source, you can send apps' audio to it (in pavucotrol or whatever applet you use) without streaming entire the desktop audio

* If none of the built-in codecs presets satisfy you, you can specify your own with `-mime` and `-format`. For example: `-mime audio/ac3 -format ac3`, `-mime audio/opus -format opus`, `-mime "audio/x-caf" -format caf` or `-mime "audio/mpeg" -format mp2`

* You can change audio features with `-rate`, `-bits` and `-channels`, e.g. `blast -rate 48000 -bits 24 -channels 1`

## Building

You need the `go` and `go-tools` toolchain, also `git`

then execute:

```
git clone https://github.com/ugjka/blast
cd blast
go build
```

now you can run blast with:
```
[user@user blast]$ ./blast
```

## Bins

Prebuilt Linux binaries are available on the releases [page](https://github.com/ugjka/blast/releases)

## Why not use pulseaudio-dlna?

This is for pipewire-pulse users.

## Caveats

* You need to allow port 9000 from LAN for the DLNA receiver to be able to access the HTTP stream, you can change it with `-port` flag
* blast monitor sink may not be visible in the pulse control applet unless you enable virtual streams

## Trivia

What on earth is "x-rincon-mp3radio"
